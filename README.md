## Project Overview
The Unity Freeride project aims to enhance ski videos by using a combination of LED lights and digital effects. The system uses an Arduino to control LED strips attached to the skier, and Python scripts to process sensor data. The final video editing is performed in Unity.

## Features
- Real-time LED control based on skier movements
- Custom detection model for skier tracking
- Integration with Unity for video editing
- Python scripts for data processing
